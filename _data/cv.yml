        - title: Offline Reinforcement learning for wireless user scheduling
          contents:
            - Collected different quality datasets on an in house user scheduling simulator.
            - Tested the performance of SOTA offline RL algorithms using the collected datasets.
            - Designed a dataset mixture scheme to improve the training performance using sub-optimal quality datsets.
        - title: Collabarative Federated learning
          contents:
            - Designed a new algorithm to make Server and Clients in Federated learning to work collaboratively.
            - Proved that in our structure, this server-client collaboration will have a faster convergence with designed learning rate.
            - Tested with real-world dataset and edge-devices.
