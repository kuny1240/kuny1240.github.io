Hello! I'm Kun Yang, a Software Engineer at Google, working on LLM based code optimization problems. I recently completed my Ph.D. at the University of Virginia (UVA), where I worked under the guidance of Professor [Cong Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/cong-shen). My research primarily focuses on LLM based code optimization problems. Our recent venture involves exploring prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs). I welcome collaboration and discussions with those who share these research interests.

For a deeper dive into my research work, publications, and academic path, I invite you to visit my website.
