Hello! I'm Kun Yang, a Senior Data Scientist at Juniper Networks, working on auto radio resource allocation for smart WIFI systems. I recently completed my Ph.D. at the University of Virginia (UVA), where I worked under the guidance of Professor [Cong Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/cong-shen). My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) and its innovative applications in optimizing wireless networks. I'm currently delving into the use of offline RL to tackle complex challenges in this field. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Federated Learning and the broader spectrum of General RL frameworks. Our recent venture involves exploring prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs). I welcome collaboration and discussions with those who share these research interests.

Apart from my academic endeavors, I'm an avid basketball player and video game enthusiast. I firmly believe that these hobbies not only foster a healthier lifestyle but also positively influence my research journey.

For a deeper dive into my research work, publications, and academic path, I invite you to visit my website.
