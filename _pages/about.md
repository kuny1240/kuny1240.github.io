Hello! I'm Kun Yang, currently in my third year of Ph.D. studies at the University of Virginia (UVA). My advisor is professor [Cong Shen](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/cong-shen). My resaerch interests iies with reinforcement learning (RL) and its potential applications in wireless network optimization. Currently, I'm delving into the application of offline RL to solve complex problems in this domain. I also have a broader interest of Federated learning and General RL frameworks. 

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing basketball and video games. I believe my hobbies can help me to build a healthier lifestyle and thus enlighten the path to my research success.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research, publications, and academic journey.
